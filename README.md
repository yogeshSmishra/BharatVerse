## 📖 About the Project
India has a vast and glorious history, encapsulated in its magnificent monuments and sculptures. However, not everyone has the opportunity to visit these sites in person.  

BharatVerse was created to bridge this gap by leveraging modern web technology to make cultural education more accessible, interactive, and engaging.  

This project is a web-based Augmented Reality experience that brings high-fidelity 3D models of Indian heritage sites and artifacts directly to the user's device. By digitally preserving these national treasures, we aim to foster a deeper appreciation for India's incredible history and provide a powerful educational tool for students and enthusiasts alike.
